#Map Coloring:

Constraint Satisfaction Problem:
A constraint satisfaction problem is a problem composed of variables that have possible values (domains) and constraints on what those values can be. A solver finds a potential solution to that problem by selecting values from the domains of each variable that fit the constraints. For more information you should check out Chapter 6 of Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (Third Edition) by Norvig and Russell.

We are going to look at the Map Coloring problem here.  The Map coloring problem is where you are provided with a map and no two adjacent states have the same color. Refer Section 6.1.1 in the book.
You are provided with the starter code and need to fill in the solveCSP method according to the instructions provided in the code itself. You only need to submit the map_color.py file for this part.
